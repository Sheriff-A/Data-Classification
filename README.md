# KMeans
This repo is for demonstration of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm

It shows the process of applying the K-Means algorithm to solve a data clustering/ classification problem.
There are two files, one of which shows the detailed processes involved in the K-Means algorithm. There is a showcase of preprocessing the data to be used, as well as setting up and solving the problem by use of K-Means. In the second file, the same problem is taken but solved by used of K-Means functionality from the scikit-learn python package. Both cases are able to quickly and efficiently solve the problem, but the bonus of the detailed process is the ability to visualize and track the flow of data in a step by step manner.
